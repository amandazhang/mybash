1.Set up your repo on your local machine
---------------------------------------------
To clone your forked repository from github onto your local machine:

$git clone < the URL of your forked repo>
$git remote -v  # check what you have on your local machine
$git remote rename origin <name you want to change into>  #change your fork name 
$git remote add origin <https://github.com/amandazhang/STAT243FinalProject.git>

$git remote -v  #Now you should be able to see four lines, two of them be the 
                 repo of your forked one, other two named 'origin' be the repo
                 of origin master


2.Version control part: Do code review on github
---------------------------------------------------
In order to keep your master branch of your forked repository clean, all of 
your works should be done in a branch other than master.


Below is the example:

*** I want to work on the first part of our module. I would first:

<Be on the master branch:>

$git pull origin master  #pull any changes from github of origin repo onto your local 

$git push <name you choose for your repo> master #push your local changes to your remote github to make your remote git(forked one) updated with origin repo.

*** Then create a new branch to save your works:
                              
$git branch <name you want for your new branch, any name but 'master', eg. 'module'>

$git branch  #you could use this to check what branches you have

$git checkout <name of branch you want to switch to, eg. 'module'>  #you would switch to 'module' branch

*** Now you can do your works under 'module' branch.
*** To save your work onto your github:

$git add 
$git commit -m ""
$git push <your forked repo name> <the branch name you're working on>

*** Now you can review your work on your github! 

*** Remember to switch to your new branch other than master on github to see the commit you made


3. Create pull request
----------------------------------

We've talked about this after class today, tutorials are better than my explanation...



I think that's all for now!
